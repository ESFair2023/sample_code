# Python example code for the ESFair Contest ESWEEK 2023.

---

**What is in this repository?**



This repository contains a simple example to illustrate how to train the model with PyTorch and evaluate the comprehensive performances in terms of Accuracy score and Fairness score.

For this example, we use the MobileNetV2 as the classifier. You can use a different classifier for your implementation.

**How do I run these scripts?**


You can run this classifier code by installing the requirements

`pip install requirements.txt`

change the dataset directory in argparser.py,

and run 

`python train.py`

After running the code, one of the scoring metrics (i.e., Accuracy score) will be reported in the file log.txt in the folder log.
